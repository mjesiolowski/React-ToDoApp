As I have started my React adventure some time ago I put some trust in my skill and decided to make this ToDoApp.

Rules:
- you can add as many tasks as you want to
- tasks length is unlimited, except for minimum value of 3 characters
- you can filter your tasks using the search button (min. 1 character required, case insensitive)
- on the bottom part you can view your last 3 done tasks (lastly done on the top of the list)
- the remove button deletes your task permanently

Technology used:
- React (CRA)
- CSS + BEM
