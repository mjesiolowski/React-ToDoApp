## Info:
As I have started my React adventure some time ago I put some trust 
in my skill and decided to make this ToDoApp.
It allows you to add, edit, delete and search your tasks. You can check 
the latest 3 done tasks at the bottom part of the application.


## Rules:
- you can add as many tasks as you want to
- tasks length is unlimited, except for minimum value of 3 characters
- you can filter your tasks using the search button (case insensitive)
- you can edit your to do tasks
- on the bottom part you can view your last 3 done tasks (lastly done task on the top of the list)
- the remove button deletes your task permanently

## Technology used:
React
Redux
CSS + BEM
