# Task App

https://mj-taskapp.herokuapp.com/

## Info:
NEVER build a task (to do) app they say, everyone builds it they say... Well, it doesn't resonate with me at all! I love being organized and I cannot imagine starting my day without looking at my tasks list, hence I found it totally exciting to build a task manager on my own.

React based task manager app with adding, editing, deleting, searching, comments and routes.

## Rules:
ADDING
- you can add as many tasks as you want to,
- tasks length is unlimited, though minimum number of 3 characters is required

EDITING
- you can edit your task details either by clicking on the 'edit' button (with a pen on it) or by clicking a task name

DELETING
- you can delete your task permanently either by clicking on the 'delete' button (with a pen on it) or in the 'edit task' section

ACTIVE TASKS
- on the bottom part you can view your last 5 done tasks (lastly done task on the top of the list)
- click on the task name to get more details

FILTERING
- you can filter your tasks using the search button (case insensitive)
- you can sort task by: creation date, name, deadline and priority

COMMENTS
- all comments are listed on the task subpage
- you can add, edit and delete comments

DATA
- local storage stores the task data


## Technology used:
React (with React Router and React Hooks),
